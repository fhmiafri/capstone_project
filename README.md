# project overview

Finding the related features affecting the used car price .

### The features :

Engine Capacity(cc) 

Engine Type - Petrol , Diesel , Hybrid , LPG , CNG

Year (1990-2021)

Mileage (kms)

Transmission type - automatic , manual 


### The Data

This data required me to do Regression analysis ,i.e : how much is this used car ?

As a Data Science lifecycle , i performed :

### Data mining - collecting data suitable with the business problem.

Data resource :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ebrahimhaquebhatti/75000-used-cars-dataset-with-specifications

### Data cleaning - removing any inconsistencies in dataset i.e duplicate , missing values , outliers, standardization and normalization

As a industry specialist, i have been working with cars for almost 6 years , i have reduced the range for Mileage(kms) and Years due to few reasons .

1990-2021 is still in acceptable range of year because of spare parts availability , workshop options , wear and tear of factory built , comfortability ,newer technology and more safety features .

Being a used car , having a 1km on the clock does not really indicate correctly and this may possibly error in dataset . Buying a brand new car from showroom must at least register 30km (car delivery, fuel filling , Road testing ).

Since last 60â€™s , car production stopped producing low engine capacities and the lowest they go since then is 660cc as we can see nowadays on the road . With this explanation , i have decided to scale my data within 660cc - 6600cc .

Dropping 3 missing values ,which is 0.004 of the data wont affect much so i decided to drop it and carry on.

### Data exploration - building graph for better understanding of the data .

### Feature engineer - manipulate features for better fit for our modeling .

Performing standardization on the baseline model .

Performing normalization for 2nd model .

### Predictive model - performed Linear Regression to train , evaluate the performance and creating predictions .

# Baseline model

after standardized , the R-squared value :

## Conclusions

After modeling ,the best fit for linear regression with 0.795 of R squared value which mean 79.5% of the data fits the regression model .
As in the t-test columns , engine capacity and the year is very highly significant .
 
With the help of low p-values , we can reject the null hypothesis (no relationship between features)

Performed a validation with T-test, with a result of Mean Squared Error(MSE) : 0.11

Performed Cross validation test , resulted in 0.12 .

In conclusion . Engine capacity(cc) , age of the car and the engine type playing a big role in car prices .
